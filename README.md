This is a custom-built application developed using Electron, providing full JavaScript capabilities for seamless integration with ChatGPT. Microphone dictation support is coming soon, with ongoing development planned. This repository will eventually evolve into a full-fledged operating system based on Arch and KDE, featuring an anime catgirl theme, with everything preconfigured for an out-of-the-box experience.
